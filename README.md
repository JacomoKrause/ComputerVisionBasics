# ComputerVisionBasics
Different approaches to get practical experiences with computer vision stuff.

Each branch contains different parts of computer vision. 
This is to ensure that different tutorials and example projects don't interfer with each other and lead to a messy project structure.
Yet I want everything collected in one repository.
